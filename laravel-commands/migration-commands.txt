php artisan make:migration create_flights_table


# To run all migrations
----------------
php artisan migrate

# checking migrate status
----------------------
php artisan migrate:status

# If you would like to see the SQL statements that will be executed by the migrations without actually running them, you may provide the --pretend flag to the migrate command

php artisan migrate --pretend

php artisan migrate --isolated

php artisan migrate --force

# Rolling Back Migrations
To roll back the latest migration operation, you may use the rollback Artisan command. This command rolls back the last "batch" of migrations, which may include multiple migration files:
---------------------------------
php artisan migrate:rollback

You may roll back a limited number of migrations by providing the step option to the rollback command. For example, the following command will roll back the last five migrations:
---------------------
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=5

# The migrate:reset command will roll back all of your application's migrations:
--------------------
php artisan migrate:reset


#Roll Back & Migrate Using A Single Command
The migrate:refresh command will roll back all of your migrations and then execute the migrate command. This command effectively re-creates your entire database:
---------------------
php artisan migrate:refresh
 
# Refresh the database and run all database seeds...
php artisan migrate:refresh --seed


# You may roll back and re-migrate a limited number of migrations by providing the step option to the refresh command. For example, the following command will roll back and re-migrate the last five migrations:
----------------------
php artisan migrate:refresh --step=5


# Drop All Tables & Migrate
The migrate:fresh command will drop all tables from the database and then execute the migrate command:
------------------------
php artisan migrate:fresh
 
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
